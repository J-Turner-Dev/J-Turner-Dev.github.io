            Currently, my front-end experience consists of building several
            websites and webapps for homework assignments as well as this web
            portfolio and displayed projects. I have an intermediate level of
            understanding for Such languages as html, css, javascript as well as
            such concepts as, media quieres and accessibility. I have also
            created interactive front-end designs, forms, and components with
            the React framework.

            I have a background in troubleshooting electro-mechanical
            malfunctions. The key to being effective is to isolate the problem
            and then find the solution to that problem. I take pride in being
            able to find a solution to a problem and produce a fix. Within the
            technology field some times it takes a creative approach to finding
            the solution. I have full confidence in myself to be able to find,
            create, or learn a solution to any problem at hand.

        <p>
          Hello, I am Joshua Turner. As the subtitle says, I have recently
          obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am embarking on a
          new career in the Information Technology and Software Development
          field. I have personally created this portfolio to explain a little
          about myself and to display the skills I have learned in the past 4
          years including displaying some projects I have worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before pursuing my degree, I was enlisted in the United States Air
          Force. I had earned the rank of Staff Sergeant within 3 years, in
          which I became a supervisor leading a maintenance team of 3 people. I
          was one of the go to supervisor's for fixing troublesome malfunctions.
          I took the time to read in depth the technical instuctions, learn
          troubleshooting procedures, and understanding wiring diagrams. I found
          that I was passionate about finding out what went wrong or broke and
          fixed the problem. I take the same approach when it comes to building
          software. The process of building software is just finding a solution
          to a problem. Most of the time, during software development
          troubleshooting is necessary. I believe these skills, my previous
          experience with working in teams, as well as my passion for building
          and creativity drive me to enjoy this new career and I can't wait to
          start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please take a look at the three selected projects below. These
          projects have been personally built or worked on by myself to show my
          ability and knowledge in creating applications with front-ends,
          back-ends, and databases. Also at the bottom of the page there is a
          link to my Github page and my Codepen page to take a look at my source
          code and other creations. Thank you!
